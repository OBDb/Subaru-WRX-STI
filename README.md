## Generations

The Subaru WRX STI represents the pinnacle of Subaru's performance engineering, with a rich motorsport heritage:

- **First Generation (2004-2007)**: The first STI officially brought to North America featured a potent EJ257 2.5L turbocharged boxer engine producing 300 hp. Notable features included a Driver Controlled Center Differential (DCCD), Brembo brakes, and distinctive gold BBS wheels. This generation established the STI's reputation for exceptional performance with its advanced all-wheel-drive system and rally-bred engineering.

- **Second Generation (2008-2014)**: The second generation brought controversial styling changes but significant performance improvements. The EJ257 engine was refined to maintain 305 hp while improving reliability. Key features included a revised DCCD system, more sophisticated SI-Drive system, and improved suspension geometry. The 2011 refresh introduced wide-body styling and handling improvements.

- **Third Generation (2015-2021)**: This generation marked significant chassis improvements while maintaining the proven EJ257 powerplant, now producing 310 hp. Notable updates included a stiffer chassis, improved aerodynamics, and more refined interior. The STI received hydraulic steering (versus the WRX's electric system) and more sophisticated differential controls. Key features included:
  - Active Torque Vectoring
  - Multi-mode Vehicle Dynamics Control
  - Upgraded Brembo braking system with cross-drilled rotors
  - Reinforced 6-speed manual transmission

- **Final Special Editions**: Before discontinuation, Subaru released several special editions including:
  - 2019 STI S209 (Limited to 209 units)
  - 2021 STI EJ25 Final Edition (Japan market)
  - Various market-specific special editions celebrating the STI's heritage

The WRX STI was discontinued after 2021, marking the end of the EJ25 era. While the standard WRX continues with a new generation, the STI nameplate has been retired from the current lineup as of 2022. [[Subaru STI Heritage]](https://www.subaru.com/enthusiasts/sti.html)
