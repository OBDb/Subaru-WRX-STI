generations:
  - name: "First Generation (GC/GF)"
    start_year: 1994
    end_year: 2000
    description: "The first-generation Subaru Impreza WRX STI (Subaru Tecnica International) was introduced in Japan as the ultimate expression of Subaru's rally technology in a road car, building upon the already-capable WRX with more power, enhanced handling, and distinctive styling elements. Available in four-door sedan (GC) and five-door wagon (GF) body styles, the original STI featured a more powerful version of the turbocharged 2.0-liter flat-four 'boxer' engine, producing up to 280 horsepower in later versions—adhering to Japan's 'gentleman's agreement' limiting advertised power output. Performance upgrades over the standard WRX included a stronger transmission, front and rear limited-slip differentials, revised suspension with STI-tuned dampers and springs, and larger brakes. Visual distinctions included a larger rear wing, more aggressive body kit, gold-painted BBS wheels that became a signature STI element, and pink STI badges. The interior featured more heavily bolstered Recaro seats, a MOMO steering wheel, and additional gauges. This generation introduced the innovative Driver Controlled Center Differential (DCCD), allowing manual adjustment of torque distribution between front and rear axles. Special variants included the legendary 22B, produced in limited numbers to celebrate Subaru's World Rally Championship success, featuring widened bodywork, a 2.2-liter engine, and unique styling elements. The first-generation STI established the blueprint for the ultimate Subaru performance car and created a devoted enthusiast following, though it was not officially imported to North America during this generation."

  - name: "Second Generation (GD/GG)"
    start_year: 2000
    end_year: 2007
    description: "The second-generation Subaru Impreza WRX STI continued to evolve the high-performance formula while expanding to new markets, including North America where it was officially introduced for the 2004 model year. Available in four-door sedan (GD) and five-door wagon (GG) body styles, though North America initially received only the sedan, the new STI featured more aggressive styling with prominent round headlights in its initial form, later revised in 2003 and 2005 facelifts. Powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter flat-four 'boxer' engine in Japan and most global markets, producing up to another Japanese-market limited 280 horsepower, while North American models received a 2.5-liter version with 300 horsepower, both paired exclusively with a six-speed manual transmission. Performance technology advanced with refined versions of the Driver Controlled Center Differential (DCCD), front and rear limited-slip differentials, and more sophisticated stability control systems that could be fully disabled for track use. Braking performance improved with larger Brembo calipers and rotors, while suspension received STI-specific tuning with upgraded components. Visual distinctions from the standard WRX included a more aggressive body kit, larger rear wing, and gold BBS wheels continuing the STI tradition. The interior featured more heavily bolstered seats, STI-branded gauges and trim elements, and a smaller-diameter steering wheel. Special editions included the limited-production Spec C with reduced weight and track-focused upgrades, and the S203/S204 in Japan with even more power and performance refinements. This generation significantly expanded the STI's global presence and enthusiast following, establishing it as a performance icon capable of competing with sports cars costing much more."

  - name: "Third Generation (GR/GV)"
    start_year: 2008
    end_year: 2014
    description: "The third-generation Subaru Impreza WRX STI represented a more significant departure from the standard Impreza, with unique bodywork and performance features further distinguishing it as a specialized performance model. Initially available only as a five-door hatchback (GR) in most markets before adding a four-door sedan (GV) option for the 2011 model year, the new STI featured an aggressive wide-body design with flared fenders, a large rear wing on sedan models, and distinctive quad exhaust outlets. Powered by a carried-over turbocharged 2.5-liter flat-four 'boxer' engine producing 305 horsepower in most markets, the STI continued to be offered exclusively with a six-speed manual transmission and Subaru's advanced all-wheel drive system featuring the Driver Controlled Center Differential (DCCD), allowing manual adjustment of torque distribution between front and rear axles. Performance technology expanded to include Subaru Intelligent Drive (SI-Drive) with three driver-selectable engine response modes and a multi-mode Vehicle Dynamics Control system allowing varying levels of stability control intervention. The suspension featured inverted struts derived from rally racing experience, aluminum lower control arms for reduced unsprung weight, and more aggressive tuning than standard WRX models. Braking was provided by Brembo calipers with cross-drilled rotors. The interior featured more heavily bolstered seats, STI-branded instrumentation with a center-mounted tachometer, aluminum pedals, and a thick-rimmed steering wheel. Special editions included the STI Spec C in Japan with reduced weight and track-focused upgrades, and the U.S.-market STI Special Edition with JDM suspension components. The third-generation STI continued to build the model's reputation for offering supercar-rivaling performance and all-weather capability in a practical package, though some enthusiasts felt it had lost some of the raw character that defined earlier versions as it became more refined and accessible."

  - name: "Fourth Generation (VA)"
    start_year: 2015
    end_year: 2021
    description: "The fourth-generation Subaru WRX STI marked the model's complete separation from the Impreza line, becoming a distinct model with its own platform modifications and styling, though still sharing some underlying architecture with the Impreza. Available exclusively as a four-door sedan in most markets, the new STI featured even more aggressive styling than the standard WRX with a larger rear wing, unique front bumper design, and more pronounced aerodynamic elements. Unlike the standard WRX, which received a new 2.0-liter direct-injection turbocharged engine, the STI maintained the previous generation's EJ25 2.5-liter turbocharged flat-four 'boxer' engine with only minor updates, producing 305 horsepower and 290 lb-ft of torque in most markets, paired exclusively with a reinforced six-speed manual transmission. The all-wheel drive system featured further refinements to the Driver Controlled Center Differential (DCCD), now using electronic control rather than the previous mechanical and electronic combined system, along with front and rear limited-slip differentials. Suspension was significantly upgraded with inverted front struts, aluminum lower control arms, and more aggressive tuning, while braking performance improved with larger Brembo calipers and cross-drilled rotors. The interior received upgrades over the standard WRX with more heavily bolstered seats featuring STI embroidery, a leather-wrapped flat-bottom steering wheel, and additional performance displays in the instrument cluster. A key focus was improving refinement without compromising performance capabilities, with a more rigid chassis, improved sound insulation, and higher quality interior materials. Special editions included the limited-production STI Type RA with reduced weight, a carbon fiber roof, enhanced engine components, and unique styling elements, and the STI S209 for the U.S. market—the first S-line STI sold outside Japan—featuring 341 horsepower and comprehensive chassis upgrades. As the last generation to use the legendary EJ25 engine that had powered STI models for nearly two decades, the fourth-generation STI maintained its position as a benchmark for affordable all-weather performance cars while offering improved daily usability and refinement."
